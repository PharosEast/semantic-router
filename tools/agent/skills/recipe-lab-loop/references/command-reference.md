# recipe-lab command reference

All commands print a single structured JSON document on stdout
(allow_nan=False, UTF-8); progress and logs go to stderr; no command reads
stdin. Exit codes: `0` success (for `live-verdict`: PASS), `1` FAIL verdict
(`live-verdict` only), `2` usage, contract or tool error, and INCONCLUSIVE
for `live-verdict`.

## Contract

- `recipe-lab plan --spec S`
  Load and validate the experiment contract and print it normalized; no
  experiment runs. Contract errors exit 2 with the reason on stderr — fix
  the spec and re-run. Every later command re-checks the same contract, so
  a spec that passes this command is the single source of truth for a round.
- `attribution.oracle_policy` (F2) takes exactly one of two forms: a
  label -> model mapping, or a rules/default mapping
  `{"rules": [{"when": {<signal>: <condition>}, "expect": {"decision":
  <decision>, "models": [<model>, ...]?}}, ...],
  "default": {"decision": ...}?}`. A condition matches one signal fact by
  label string, finite number, or a numeric predicate mapping over
  `gte|lte|gt|lt` (router semantics: `gte` fails when the value is below
  the bound). The first matching rule wins, the optional default covers
  the rest, and truth no rule covers is a policy gap.

## Dataset identity and splits (stage 2)

- `recipe-lab hash --file F`
  Frozen dataset identity: `sha256:` + hash of the raw bytes (A4). The spec's
  workload records this hash; every command that touches the dataset re-hashes
  and refuses drift (exit 2).
- `recipe-lab split --cases C --output-dir D [--group-key source_id
  --ratios 0.4,0.3,0.3 --seed 42]`
  Deterministic group-level three-way split (B): `calib.jsonl`, `dev.jsonl`,
  `frozen_test.jsonl`. Same input + same flags -> byte-identical output.
  `frozen_test` is quarantined: only `live-verdict --final` may cite it.

## Evidence intake

- `recipe-lab attribute --spec S [--split calib|dev] --records R
  [--cases C] --output-dir D`
  E1/E2/E3 misroute attribution; writes `attribution.jsonl`, `summary.json`
  (the summarize() result, read by `next`, G3) and `report.md`.
  The split manifest is re-hashed (A4); optional `--cases` verifies the
  attribution input against the split identity. `frozen_test` is refused.
- `recipe-lab attribute-session --records R --output-dir D`
  Session-aware agentic attribution (P2): aggregates replay rows that carry
  session evidence (conversation_id / turn_index) into conversations and
  layers three evidence classes on top of single-turn E1/E2/E3 (never
  redefining them): `lane_flap` (adjacent requests of one conversation chose
  different models), `selection_failed` (recorded failed selections) and
  `tool_loop_interrupted` (a rejected selection whose turn resumed
  afterwards; needs the rejection-recording router fix). Writes
  `session-report.md` and `session-events.json`; deterministic - same rows,
  same report bytes.
- `recipe-lab collect-replays --url http://127.0.0.1:8080
  [--cases C | --unlabeled] --output R --family d3`
  Pulls router_replay records from the management API and joins them with
  labeled cases. Skipped rows are counted (`no_prompt`/`unlabeled`/
  `duplicate_prompt`), never guessed. `--unlabeled` skips the labeled join
  and emits one raw diagnostic row per replay record - the `diagnose`
  input; mutually exclusive with `--cases`.
- `recipe-lab bank build --cases C --models M1,M2 --endpoint U --output B`
  Direct per-case/per-model queries graded by `expected_contains`.
- `recipe-lab bank apply --bank B --records R [--output R2]`
  Joins correctness by (case_id, routed model); missing entries stay
  `no_evidence`.

## Diagnosis and distribution calibration (D)

Both commands need no ground truth: they turn unlabeled traffic into
proposals.

- `recipe-lab diagnose --records R --config C --output-dir D
  [--expect-rare d1,d2] [--rare-pct P] [--min-sample N]
  [--utilization-warn U] [--source "..."]`
  Three checks over replay rows: decisions that never fire (dead) or fire
  under `--rare-pct` traffic share (rare; `--expect-rare` whitelists
  legitimately rare decisions such as security containment - reported,
  never warned), per-signal quantiles / histogram / range utilization
  (`--utilization-warn` flags a signal using less of its known range;
  `--min-sample` warns when the sample count is too small), and rule
  predicate sites no traffic ever satisfies (unreachable). `--records` is
  the `collect-replays --unlabeled` output. Writes `diagnosis.json`
  (recipe-lab-diagnosis-v1, input-hashed, byte-stable - the
  `next --diagnosis` input) and `diagnosis.md`.
- `recipe-lab propose-calibrated --diagnosis D --base-config C --signal S
  [--from V] [--quantiles Q1,Q2 | --target-share F] [--op gte|gt|lte|lt]
  [--lo L] [--hi H] [--output-dir D]`
  Rule threshold candidates at the signal's observed distribution
  quantiles, or at a target traffic share (quantile `1 - share`). Uses the
  rule-level proposer, so all rule sites sharing (signal, op, value) move
  together; each candidate sidecar cites the diagnosis it came from, and a
  diagnosis whose config hash does not match `--base-config` is rejected
  (exit 2). `--from` restricts the move to sites currently at that value
  (the 2.5 -> 1.75 BUG-3 calibration).

## Proposal and replay tier

- `recipe-lab propose-thresholds --base-config C --signal S --deltas=-0.1,0.1
  --output-dir D`
  Deterministic single-variable threshold candidates (baseline dropped,
  clamped to [--lo, --hi]).
- `recipe-lab propose-rule-thresholds --base-config C --signal S
  [--from V] --values V1,V2 --output-dir D [--decisions D1,D2
  --allow-partial --op gte --lo L --hi H --list-sites]`
  Moves every rule-level predicate site of one signal to each target value,
  including sites under NOT branches (C; the BUG-3 golden case moves four
  `difficulty gte 2.5` sites to 1.75 in one shot). Each candidate config
  ships a `<stem>.candidate.json` sidecar with kind/ref/change_summary/
  provenance/sites that `run` records in the ledger.
- `recipe-lab run --spec S [--split calib|dev] --cases C
  --bank B --candidates D [--baseline-config B] --proposer P --ledger L
  --output-dir D --router-bin BIN --mock-backend M [--mock-extra-args "..."]
  [--validate [--validate-bin vllm-sr]] [--attribution-ref REF]
  [--insight-refs "..."] [--round N]`
  One router lifecycle per candidate; RANKED records land in the ledger.
  The split identity is re-hashed before any stack work (A4); the trial
  deadline is `budget.max_minutes_per_trial` (A5, timed-out candidates get
  `status=timeout` and never rank). `--validate` pre-flights each candidate
  with `<bin> config validate`; rejected candidates never reach the ledger,
  all-rejected exits 2. `--candidates` accepts a directory, a comma-separated
  list, or a single config path — the agent's own proposal entry: pass one
  config plus `--proposer agent:<id>` so the ledger records who proposed it.

## Insight references (stage 2)

`--insight-refs` (comma-separated, on `run`, `ledger append` and
`live-verdict`) merges provenance links into
`candidate.provenance.insight_refs`; unverifiable references exit 2:
- `rec-<id>` - an existing ledger record_id (G1: every record carries one)
- `bench:<run_id>` - a benchmark run id (format-checked)
- `attr:<path>@sha256:<hex>` - attribution artifact, hash-verified
- `diag:<path>@sha256:<hex>#<anchor>` - diagnostic artifact with an anchor

## Live tier

- `recipe-lab live-verdict --spec S [--split dev|calib|frozen_test] --final?
  --baseline-run-id A --candidate-run-id B [--guard-measurements M]
  [--candidate J] [--insight-refs R]
  [--ledger L] [--srbench-bin vllm-sr --srbench-url U --srbench-store P]`
  Compares two sr-bench runs, applies guard floors, records the three-state
  verdict with gates and bench_refs. `frozen_test` requires `--final`
  (the promotion verdict is its only consumer, B).
- Guards (A3): floors come only from `spec.gates`. `--guard-measurements`
  is a JSONL of measurements only - `{"name": "pii-recall-floor",
  "candidate": 0.97, "baseline": 0.96}`; a `floor` key in the file is a
  contract bypass and exits 2. `floor: baseline` in the contract resolves
  against the measured baseline value. A gate without a usable measurement
  is unevaluated (verdict INCONCLUSIVE); undeclared measurement names are
  reported but never veto.
- Constraints (E): `objective.constraints` declares economic conditions
  (`{name, metric, op gte|lte, bound: "baseline"|<number>, tolerance_pct}`);
  distinct from gates, which are safety vetoes. Verified sr-bench compare
  cost fields: `total_spend_usd`, `cache_neutral_cost_usd`, `cost_usd`,
  `evaluation_cost_usd` on the baseline_targets/candidate_targets entries.
  Unknown usage is null -> the constraint is INCONCLUSIVE (never zero).
  Constraint evidence lands in the record's `constraints` field.

## Reporting

- `recipe-lab ledger show|append|top`
- `recipe-lab report --ledger L --output R` - ledger-only replay with a
  consistency check.
- `recipe-lab next --spec S --ledger L [--diagnosis diag/diagnosis.json]
  --output C [--tail N]` - full agent context export (G3), byte-stable for
  the same inputs. Sections: untrusted-material header; contract summary
  (objective, replay_metric, constraints, gates, split names + hashes,
  budget used/remaining); ledger tail; best replay candidate (ranked by
  `objective.replay_metric` through the same `best_replay` selection as
  `ledger top`, A2); last live verdict with reasons, gates, constraints and
  bench_refs; latest attribution summary read through the newest record's
  hash-verified `attribution_ref`; optional diagnosis highlights (dead/rare
  decisions, unreachable threshold sites); and a citable insight-ref list -
  paste those refs verbatim into `--insight-refs` when proposing (step 3).
- `recipe-lab provenance --ledger L --output M` - recipe-lab-run-v1 manifest.
- `recipe-lab record-draft --ledger L --output D` - promotion draft from the
  latest PASS live record (human checklist included).

## Notes

- Replay tier needs no LLM backend: the router and signal model run on CPU.
- A store with prior sr-bench execution evidence refuses autostart; start it
  explicitly with `SR_BENCH_STORE=<path> vllm-sr benchmark serve`.
- The router's benchmark binding supports `X-SR-Bench-Max-Inference-Calls: 1`
  only (`pkg/extproc/benchmark_config_binding.go`).
